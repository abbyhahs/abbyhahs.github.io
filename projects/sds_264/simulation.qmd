In this study, participants were asked to imagine they moved to a new state and were filling out the form for a new drivers license. Some were given the option to opt-in to being an organ donor (being a non-donor is the default), others were given the option to opt-out of being a donor (donor is the default), and there was a neutral group with no default option.


```{r}
#| include: false

#data#

organ_data <- tibble(option = rep(c("Opt-in", "Opt-out", "Neutral"), each = 50),
                       choice = c(rep("Donor", 21), rep("Non-Donor", 29), 
                                   rep("Donor", 41), rep("Non-Donor", 9),
                                  rep("Donor", 39), rep("Non-Donor", 11)))
print(organ_data, n = Inf)

sample(organ_data$option)
```




```{r}
#| include: false

#function#

histogram <- function(dataset, xvar, value, title, x)  {
  ggplot() +
    geom_histogram(data = dataset, mapping = aes(x = {{ xvar }})) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = value, color = "red") +
    labs(title = title, x = x) +
    theme_bw()
    }
```

```{r}
#| include: false

organ_summary <- organ_data |>
  group_by(option) |>
  summarize(prop_donor = mean(choice == "Donor"))
```

First, I ran a Chi-Squared Test to see if the response (Donor or Non-Donor) was related to the group (Opt-in, Opt-out, Neutral).

```{r}
#| include: FALSE
chisq_p <- chisq.test(table(organ_data))$p.value
chisq_s <- chisq.test(table(organ_data))$statistic
```

```{r}
#| include: FALSE

#simulation#

chisq2 <- vector("double", 1000)
for(i in 1:1000) {
  organ_data2 <- organ_data |>
    mutate(option = sample(option)) 
  chisq2[i] <- chisq.test(table(organ_data2))$statistic}
```

```{r}
#| echo: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
null_hypothesis2 <- tibble(chisq2 = chisq2)

histogram(dataset = null_hypothesis2, xvar = chisq2, value = chisq_s, title = "Simulated Chi-Squared Test Statistics", x = "Chi-Squared Values")

p_value2 <- sum(abs(chisq2) >= abs(chisq_s)) / 1000
p_value2
```

The plot depicts a histogram of the 1000 simulated chi-squared values for the data. The histogram is skewed right, which is expected for a chi-squared distribution. The red line marks the chi-squared statistic for the observed data which is 22.1. The p value (stated above) is < 0.05 which tells us there is a significant difference between the simulated and observed chi-squared statistics. There is significant evidence that the different options of opt-in, opt-out, and neutral do have an effect on whether or not individuals decide to be a donor.


Then I decided to look specifically at the effect of Opt-in or Opt-out when compared to Neutral.

```{r}
#| include: false 
#opt in vs neutral#

organ_summary1 <- organ_data |>
  group_by(option) |>
  summarize(prop_donor = mean(choice == "Donor"))
observed_diff1 <- organ_summary1[[2]][2] - organ_summary1[[2]][1]

```

```{r}
#| include: false

#simulation#

simulated_diffs1 <- vector("double", 1000)
for(i in 1:1000) {
  organ_summary1 <- organ_data |>
    mutate(option = sample(option)) |>
    group_by(option) |>
    summarize(prop_donor = mean(choice == "Donor"))
  simulated_diffs1[[i]] <- organ_summary1[[2]][2] - organ_summary1[[2]][1]}
```

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| echo: false
null_hypothesis1 <- tibble(simulated_diffs1 = simulated_diffs1)

histogram(dataset = null_hypothesis1, xvar = simulated_diffs1, value = observed_diff1, title = "Simulated Differences in Donor Rates Between Opt-in and Neutral", x = "Simulated Differences (Opt-in - Neutral)")

p_value1 <- sum(abs(simulated_diffs1) >= abs(observed_diff1)) / 1000
p_value1
```

The plot depicts a histogram of the 1000 simulated differences between the rate of donors when given the option to opt-in to being a donor compared to when the option is neutral. The histogram is approximately normal and centered at zero. The red line marks the observed difference between opt-in and neutral which is -0.36. This means that from the observed data, when the option is neutral we can expect donor rates to be 36% higher than when participants have to opt-in to being a donor. Additionally, the p value (stated above) is < 0.05 which means there is a significant difference between the two groups.

```{r}
#| include: false
#opt-out vs neutral#
organ_summary3 <- organ_data |>
  group_by(option) |>
  summarize(prop_donor = mean(choice == "Donor"))
observed_diff3 <- organ_summary3[[2]][3] - organ_summary3[[2]][1]
```

```{r}
#| include: false

#simulation#

simulated_diffs3 <- vector("double", 1000)
for(i in 1:1000) {
  organ_summary3 <- organ_data |>
    mutate(option = sample(option)) |>
    group_by(option) |>
    summarize(prop_donor = mean(choice == "Donor"))
  simulated_diffs3[[i]] <- organ_summary3[[2]][3] - organ_summary3[[2]][1]}
```

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| echo: false
null_hypothesis3 <- tibble(simulated_diffs3 = simulated_diffs3)

histogram(dataset = null_hypothesis3, xvar = simulated_diffs3, value = observed_diff3, title = "Simulated Differences in Donor Rates Between Opt-out and Neutral", x = "Simulated Differences (Opt-out - Neutral)")

p_value3 <- sum(abs(simulated_diffs3) >= abs(observed_diff3)) / 1000
p_value3
```

The plot depicts a histogram of the 1000 simulated differences between the rate of donors when given the option to opt-out to being a donor compared to when the option is neutral. The histogram is approximately normal and centered at zero. The red line marks the observed difference between opt-out and neutral which is 0.04. This means that from the observed data, when the option is neutral we can expect donor rates to be 4% lower than when participants have to opt-out of being a donor. Additionally, the p value (stated above) is > 0.05 which means there is not a significant difference between the two groups.



In conclusion, the Chi-Squared test told us that the choice to be a donor is definitely related to the different options that are given. When taking a closer look at the different options, we can conclude that there is a significant difference in donor rates between the options of opt-in and neutral. There is not a significant difference in donor rates between opt-out and neutral. Therefore, if a state wanted to have high donor rates, based off this study and the simulation, they should either make citizens have to opt-out of being a donor or phrase the question in a neutral way.

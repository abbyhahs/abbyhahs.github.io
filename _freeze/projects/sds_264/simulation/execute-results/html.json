Some were given the option to opt-in to being an organ donor (being a non-donor is the default), others were given the option to opt-out of being a donor (donor is the default), and there was a neutral group with no default option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, I ran a Chi-Squared Test to see if the response (Donor or Non-Donor) was related to the group (Opt-in, Opt-out, Neutral).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](simulation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe plot depicts a histogram of the 1000 simulated chi-squared values for the data. The histogram is skewed right, which is expected for a chi-squared distribution. The red line marks the chi-squared statistic for the observed data which is 22.1. The p value (stated above) is < 0.05 which tells us there is a significant difference between the simulated and observed chi-squared statistics. There is significant evidence that the different options of opt-in, opt-out, and neutral do have an effect on whether or not individuals decide to be a donor.\n\n\nThen I decided to look specifically at the effect of Opt-in or Opt-out when compared to Neutral.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](simulation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe plot depicts a histogram of the 1000 simulated differences between the rate of donors when given the option to opt-in to being a donor compared to when the option is neutral. The histogram is approximately normal and centered at zero. The red line marks the observed difference between opt-in and neutral which is -0.36. This means that from the observed data, when the option is neutral we can expect donor rates to be 36% higher than when participants have to opt-in to being a donor. Additionally, the p value (stated above) is < 0.05 which means there is a significant difference between the two groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](simulation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.762\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe plot depicts a histogram of the 1000 simulated differences between the rate of donors when given the option to opt-out to being a donor compared to when the option is neutral. The histogram is approximately normal and centered at zero. The red line marks the observed difference between opt-out and neutral which is 0.04. This means that from the observed data, when the option is neutral we can expect donor rates to be 4% lower than when participants have to opt-out of being a donor. Additionally, the p value (stated above) is > 0.05 which means there is not a significant difference between the two groups.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, the Chi-Squared test told us that the choice to be a donor is definitely related to the different options that are given. When taking a closer look at the different options, we can conclude that there is a significant difference in donor rates between the options of opt-in and neutral. There is not a significant difference in donor rates between opt-out and neutral. Therefore, if a state wanted to have high donor rates, based off this study and the simulation, they should either make citizens have to opt-out of being a donor or phrase the question in a neutral way.\n\n",

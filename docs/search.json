    "text": "By looking at this plot of Wisconsin’s Congressional Districts and the proportion of Republican votes in each district, we can conclude that there is evidence of gerrymandering. Districts 2, 3, and 4 have a clear Democratic majority, but none of the districts that Republican’s won have above a 75% Republican majority. Due to the low proportion of Republican votes, it seems that the congressional districts have been engineered so that Republican’s just barely have the majority in all districts except for 2, 3, and 4."

    "text": "Donald Trump is very well known for his use of the Twitter platform to promote his presidential campaign and his strong opinions. He was very vocal on the platform and is the only President to have been banned from Twitter.\nBelow is a graph of all Trump’s tweets from his account @realDonaldTrump starting on January 1, 2016, one year before he was inaugurated President and ending January 8, 2021, the day he was temporarily banned from Twitter. The vertical red lines represent the start and end of Trump’s presidency. As we can see, the amount of tweets greatly increases and stays high during and after the 2020 election season. There is also a relatively low number of tweets during the start of his presidency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyear\ntotal_tweets\ntotal_capital_letters\ntotal_favorites\ntotal_retweets\n\n\n\n\n2016\n3982\n46751\n71645843\n25618233\n\n\n2017\n2598\n30731\n161523601\n38051871\n\n\n2018\n3566\n49598\n234277534\n57871171\n\n\n2019\n7813\n100993\n365992656\n113768353\n\n\n2020\n12223\n161083\n729630178\n233935942\n\n\n2021\n156\n1840\n21737052\n6032036\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove are the analytics of Trump’s tweets by year. Keeping in mind that the 2021 data includes only eight days, we observe that 2017 had the least amount of tweets. 2020 had the most capital letters, likes and retweets, which makes sense given that it is also the year with the most tweets. It’s clear that Trump became more active on Twitter toward the end of his term and especially when promoting his campaign for re-election in 2020.\nNext, I decided to look at the five accounts that Trump retweeted the most. I found that Trump most often retweeted tweets from his own account (realDonaldTrump) and his second most retweeted account was the White House. GOP Chairwoman, Dan Scavino, and Team Trump were the 3rd - 5th most retweeted accounts.\n\n\n\n\n\nretweet\nn\n\n\n\n\n@realDonaldTrump:\n966\n\n\n@WhiteHouse:\n438\n\n\n@GOPChairwoman:\n185\n\n\n@DanScavino:\n150\n\n\n@TeamTrump:\n139\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this data, I then looked at the date and amount of retweets of Trump’s most commonly retweeted accounts.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at each account individually,\n@DanScavino’s tweets were most commonly retweeted by Trump between 2019 and 2021 which makes sense given that Scavino was the White House Deputy Chief of Staff of Communications for the Trump administration beginning in 2020.\nThe @GOPChairwoman account was ran by Ronna McDaniel who was the Republican National Committee chairwoman and her tweets were mostly retweeted between 2019 and 2021.\n@realDonaldTrump is Trump’s personal account and he often retweeted his own tweets, especially leading up to and after the 2020 election.\n@TeamTrump was used mostly during Trump’s campaign times, which explains why it was mostly retweeted during election season.\n@WhiteHouse is the official account of the White House and we can see it was mostly retweeted during Trump’s time in office.\nBelow are Trump’s ten most commonly used two word phrases.\n\n\n\n\n\ntwo_words\nn\n\n\n\n\nFake News\n406\n\n\nPresident Trump\n393\n\n\nJoe Biden\n312\n\n\nGREAT AGAIN\n281\n\n\nUnited States\n277\n\n\nTHANK YOU\n270\n\n\nMAKE AMERICA\n267\n\n\nCrooked Hillary\n231\n\n\nNew York\n205\n\n\nThe Democrats\n203\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter seeing these phrases, I wanted to see when they appeared in his tweets from 2016 - 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe phrase “Crooked Hillary” was used most often during the 2017 election season, which makes sense given that Hillary Clinton was Trump’s main competitor for the 2017 election.\nThe phrases “Make America” and “Great Again” were used pretty evenly throughout Trump’s presidency, which is expected given that “Make America Great Again” was his main campaign slogan.\n“Fake News”, “New York”, “President Trump”, “Thank you”, “The Democrats”, and “United States” were all used more often towards the end of Trump’s presidency and during the 2020 election.\n“Joe Biden” wasn’t used until about 2019 and then was used extremely heavily during the end of 2020 and 2021, which was when Biden was running for office against Trump.\n\nIn conclusion, a lot of insight into Trump’s tweeting style can be gained by extracting data from his tweets and plotting the results."

    "text": "In this study, participants were asked to imagine they moved to a new state and were filling out the form for a new drivers license. Some were given the option to opt-in to being an organ donor (being a non-donor is the default), others were given the option to opt-out of being a donor (donor is the default), and there was a neutral group with no default option.\nFirst, I ran a Chi-Squared Test to see if the response (Donor or Non-Donor) was related to the group (Opt-in, Opt-out, Neutral).\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] 0\n\n\nThe plot depicts a histogram of the 1000 simulated chi-squared values for the data. The histogram is skewed right, which is expected for a chi-squared distribution. The red line marks the chi-squared statistic for the observed data which is 22.1. The p value (stated above) is &lt; 0.05 which tells us there is a significant difference between the simulated and observed chi-squared statistics. There is significant evidence that the different options of opt-in, opt-out, and neutral do have an effect on whether or not individuals decide to be a donor.\nThen I decided to look specifically at the effect of Opt-in or Opt-out when compared to Neutral.\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] 0\n\n\nThe plot depicts a histogram of the 1000 simulated differences between the rate of donors when given the option to opt-in to being a donor compared to when the option is neutral. The histogram is approximately normal and centered at zero. The red line marks the observed difference between opt-in and neutral which is -0.36. This means that from the observed data, when the option is neutral we can expect donor rates to be 36% higher than when participants have to opt-in to being a donor. Additionally, the p value (stated above) is &lt; 0.05 which means there is a significant difference between the two groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] 0.74\n\n\nThe plot depicts a histogram of the 1000 simulated differences between the rate of donors when given the option to opt-out to being a donor compared to when the option is neutral. The histogram is approximately normal and centered at zero. The red line marks the observed difference between opt-out and neutral which is 0.04. This means that from the observed data, when the option is neutral we can expect donor rates to be 4% lower than when participants have to opt-out of being a donor. Additionally, the p value (stated above) is &gt; 0.05 which means there is not a significant difference between the two groups.\nIn conclusion, the Chi-Squared test told us that the choice to be a donor is definitely related to the different options that are given. When taking a closer look at the different options, we can conclude that there is a significant difference in donor rates between the options of opt-in and neutral. There is not a significant difference in donor rates between opt-out and neutral. Therefore, if a state wanted to have high donor rates, based off this study and the simulation, they should either make citizens have to opt-out of being a donor or phrase the question in a neutral way."

    "text": "This plot depicts the estimated percentage of all kinds of healthcare workers who received the Influenza vaccine in 2020-21. The percentage was estimated based on a sample taken throughout each state. We learn that Oregon, Nevada, and Florida have the lowest influenza vaccination rate at about 70-75%. The states with the highest vaccination rates are Colorado, South Dakota, and Massachusetts with above a 95% vaccination rate. There doesn’t appear to be any clear geographical trends in Influenza vaccinations."

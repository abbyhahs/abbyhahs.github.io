    "text": "By looking at this plot of Wisconsin’s Congressional Districts and the proportion of Republican votes in each district, we can conclude that there is evidence of gerrymandering. Districts 2, 3, and 4 have a clear Democratic majority, but none of the districts that Republican’s won have above a 75% Republican majority. Due to the low proportion of Republican votes, it seems that the congressional districts have been engineered so that Republican’s just barely have the majority in all districts except for 2, 3, and 4."

    "text": "In this study, participants were asked to imagine they moved to a new state and were filling out the form for a new drivers license. Some were given the option to opt-in to being an organ donor (being a non-donor is the default), others were given the option to opt-out of being a donor (donor is the default), and there was a neutral group with no default option.\nFirst, I ran a Chi-Squared Test to see if the response (Donor or Non-Donor) was related to the group (Opt-in, Opt-out, Neutral).\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] 0\n\n\nThe plot depicts a histogram of the 1000 simulated chi-squared values for the data. The histogram is skewed right, which is expected for a chi-squared distribution. The red line marks the chi-squared statistic for the observed data which is 22.1. The p value (stated above) is &lt; 0.05 which tells us there is a significant difference between the simulated and observed chi-squared statistics. There is significant evidence that the different options of opt-in, opt-out, and neutral do have an effect on whether or not individuals decide to be a donor.\nThen I decided to look specifically at the effect of Opt-in or Opt-out when compared to Neutral.\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] 0\n\n\nThe plot depicts a histogram of the 1000 simulated differences between the rate of donors when given the option to opt-in to being a donor compared to when the option is neutral. The histogram is approximately normal and centered at zero. The red line marks the observed difference between opt-in and neutral which is -0.36. This means that from the observed data, when the option is neutral we can expect donor rates to be 36% higher than when participants have to opt-in to being a donor. Additionally, the p value (stated above) is &lt; 0.05 which means there is a significant difference between the two groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] 0.736\n\n\nThe plot depicts a histogram of the 1000 simulated differences between the rate of donors when given the option to opt-out to being a donor compared to when the option is neutral. The histogram is approximately normal and centered at zero. The red line marks the observed difference between opt-out and neutral which is 0.04. This means that from the observed data, when the option is neutral we can expect donor rates to be 4% lower than when participants have to opt-out of being a donor. Additionally, the p value (stated above) is &gt; 0.05 which means there is not a significant difference between the two groups.\nIn conclusion, the Chi-Squared test told us that the choice to be a donor is definitely related to the different options that are given. When taking a closer look at the different options, we can conclude that there is a significant difference in donor rates between the options of opt-in and neutral. There is not a significant difference in donor rates between opt-out and neutral. Therefore, if a state wanted to have high donor rates, based off this study and the simulation, they should either make citizens have to opt-out of being a donor or phrase the question in a neutral way."

The percentage was estimated based on a sample taken throughout each state. We learn that Oregon, Nevada, and Florida have the lowest influenza vaccination rate at about 70-75%. The states with the highest vaccination rates are Colorado, South Dakota, and Massachusetts with above a 95% vaccination rate. There doesn’t appear to be any clear geographical trends in Influenza vaccinations."

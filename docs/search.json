Districts 2 and 3 have a clear Democratic majority, but none of the “Republican” districts have above a 75% majority. Due to the low proportion of Republican votes, it seems that the congressional districts have been engineered so that Republican just barely has the majority in all districts except for 2 and 3."

The percentage was estimated based on a sample size taken throughout the state. We learn that Oregon, Nevada, and Florida have the lowest influenza vaccination rate at about 70-75%. States such as Colorado, South Dakota, and Massachusetts have above a 95% vaccination rate. There doesn’t appear to be any clear geographical trends in Influenza vaccinations."
